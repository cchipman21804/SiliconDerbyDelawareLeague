Explain it all here:

js ------------------- Javascript (script.js) to interpret keyboard commands for index-js.php (needs to be copied to /var/www/html)
js/script.js --------- ties into the built-in accelerometer of the user's connected mobile device to accept directional & speed input

php ------------------ PHP scripts for the Apache web server that need to be copied (via sudo cp) to /var/www/html
                       For example: if using keyboard commands, copy index-js.php to /var/www/html/index.php
php/controls.php ----- accepts directional input from the index-*.php for storage in txt/command.txt
php/speed.php -------- accepts speed input from the index-*.php for storage in txt/speed.txt

Pick one to mv to /var/www/html/index.php depending on desired human interface device:
php/index-accel.php -- accepts directional & speed control from the user via their connected mobile device's built-in accelerometer
php/index-js.php ----- accepts directional and speed control from the user via their connected device's keyboard
php/index.php -------- accepts directional and speed control from the user via their connected device's mouse

py ------------------- Python scripts for various functions
py/oled-display.py --- retrieves system IP address & contents of txt/* for display on OLED
                       (requires installation of Python module adafruit-circuitpython-ssd1306)
                       (OLED custom fonts requires installation of PIL)
                       (requires I2C enabled in raspi-config)
py/video-stream.py --- initiates video stream from the Raspberry Pi's camera for display on webpage generated by index-*.php
                       (requires Legacy Camera Support enabled in raspi-config)
py/wifi-car.py ------- retrieves contents of txt/* and translates their contents into GPIO commands which operate the vehicle's DC motors through H-bridge control
                       circuits

txt ------------------ non-volatile storage for current command & current speed
txt/command.txt ------ stores current directional command
txt/speed.txt -------- stores current speed

This robot requires the installation of Apache2 web server, PHP interpreter, and associated libraries:
"sudo apt install apache2 php libapache2-mod-php"

The OLED display requires the installation of the Adafruit OLED Python module & PIL custom fonts libraries:
"sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-ssd1306"
"sudo apt-get install python3-pil"
