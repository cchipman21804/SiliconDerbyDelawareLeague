Explain it all here:

js --- Javascript (script.js) to interpret keyboard commands for index-js.php (needs to be copied to /var/www/html)
php -- PHP scripts for the Apache web server that need to be copied (via sudo cp) to /var/www/html
       if using keyboard commands, rename (mv) index-js.php to index.php
py --- Python scripts for various functions
txt -- non-volatile storage for current command & current speed

php/controls.php ----- accepts directional input from the index-*.php for storage in txt/command.txt
php/index-accel.php -- accepts directional & speed control from the user via their connected mobile device's built-in accelerometer
php/index-js.php ----- accepts directional and speed control from the user via their connected device's keyboard
php/index.php -------- accepts directional and speed control from the user via their connected device's mouse
php/speed.php -------- accepts speed input from the index-*.php for storage in txt/speed.txt

js/script.js --------- ties into the built-in accelerometer of the user's connected mobile device to accept directional & speed input

py/oled-display.py --- retrieves system IP address & contents of txt/* for display on OLED
py/video-stream.py --- initiates video stream from the Raspberry Pi's camera for display on webpage generated by index-*.php
py/wifi-car.py ------- retrieves contents of txt/* and translates their contents into GPIO commands which operate the vehicle's DC motors
